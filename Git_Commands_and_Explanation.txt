Git and GitHub Tutorial - youtube - Kunal Kushwaha - 16/10/2025

Repository - It's a folder where all the changes of code are saved.

GUI - GitLab, BitBucket, GitHub - Version control tool

To download - go to git-scm.com download based on the operating system Linux, Windows or Mac

In my Windows I have installed Git Bash App to use the Git command prompt

1. ls  listing all the folder files

2. cd..  go back one previous folder

3. On reaching just / --> now, if you want to change the directory from C: to D: drive, write D: and press Enter command, now you are in D: drive

4. If you want to create a folder use a command mkdir foldername (mkdir refers to make directory)

5. To start having recording history to the folder, we must initiate git by using command git init ( You will receive a response as Initialized empty Git repository in D:/project_git_learn/.git/ )

6. Now, if you try to list the folders, you can't see the anything --> to see the hidden files ( example file name which starts with . ) use ls -a --> Now, you will see the file names such as ./  ../  .git/

7. to create a file touch command is used, it's a linux command example touch git statusnames.txt

8. to check the status git status is used

9. to delete or remove unwanted file, you can use rm -rf file name example rm -rf names2.txt

10. when you check git status in red colour untracked file will be displayed. Now, to have them as a tracked file 
git add . (it will add all the files listed in the red colour from git status)
if you don't want to add all, wish to add selective files then git add names.txt (you can add selective files names)

11. on checking the git status again, tracked files will be changed from red to green colour

12. now that they are in green colour you want to save the changes you have made, for that 
git commit -m "names.txt file added"  ( can be used -m refers to message of the commit )
git commit -m "names.txt file added"
[master (root-commit) 1f0a0c3] names.txt file added
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)  //0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-) --> zero code changes are done and zero code delection is done.
 create mode 100644 names.txt


13. If no changes are made any where then on git status below message is displayed.
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean ( is displayed)

14. to enter into .txt file from git bash and write some text and  save & quit steps
14.1 use vi names.txt
14.2 write some text inside the file
14.3 to save and quit, first click Esc button and in the below left corner type :wq or :x and click on Enter button to save it.

15. to see what is written inside the .txt folder, we can use the command
cat names.txt  ( it will display the contents present inside the .txt file )

16. Once you add to git using git add .  and didn't commit 
Wish to not to add changes to staging, we can go back by not saving to staging using command
git restore --staged names.txt ( it will not bring changes to staging env. it remains in modified: names.txt in red colour on checking git status )

17. to the previous commit history
git log is used 
Example:
$ git log
commit d43c6551e6cd10fdabf36a8330de514ff3f80d23 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Akarsh Kantimath <akarshkantimath@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 16 20:56:04 2025 +0530  //+0530 is the Indian time zone 

    names.txt file is modified

commit 1f0a0c3c3f67cf785e063cefe34861a7d7ea9e0f
Author: Akarsh Kantimath <akarshkantimath@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 16 19:38:46 2025 +0530

    names.txt file added


18. command clear is used to clean the git bash display screen of previous commands.

19. to go back to the previous commit
git reset 1f0a0c3c3f67cf785e063cefe34861a7d7ea9e0f
1f0a0c3c3f67cf785e063cefe34861a7d7ea9e0f ( commit index value )

20. Now, you made changes to the project but don't want to make commit to create a history of changes but, whenever you need you want to get those changes to your project. In this case stash is used
To use the stash get the changes to stage env. then use git stash
( from point 19 you will reset to previous commit, then make changes to repository get them to staging then you can stash them )

21. git stash pop 
It's a command used get the stash changes to unstaged areas
git stash pop
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   houses.txt
        new file:   surname.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        deleted:    names.txt


22. If you don't want any stash changes then by using command 
git stash clear (now, stash changes are gone)

23. How to attach the GitHub repository to the local machine gitBash, By using command
git remote add origin https://github.com/Akarsh-Kantimath/Git-and-GitHub-tutorial-by-Kunal-Kushwaha-31-10-2025.git
https:// link is received from GitHub once creating the new repository

24. To know what all links attached to the folder of local machine, We can use the command
git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Akarsh-Kantimath/Git-and-GitHub-tutorial-by-Kunal-Kushwaha-31-10-2025.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Akarsh-Kantimath/Git-and-GitHub-tutorial-by-Kunal-Kushwaha-31-10-2025.git (push)

25. To push the changes to GitHub repository, command 
git push origin master 
is used

26. To create a new branch 
git branch feature 
is used feature is a branch name

27. To point HEAD to branch 
git checkout feature 
command is used, HEAD refers to the branch to which changes we want to apply - if we want to add changes to master branch then we can use the command as 
git checkout master
now, to the master branch HEAD is pointed and changes are applied to master branch

28. now, for the new feature approval is received wish to merge it to the main branch 
git merge feature command is used

29. to push commit stag changes to the GitHub command
git push origin master 
is used, master is a branch name

30. in GitHub in order to contribute to a project, initially we must fork the project 
on choosing GitHub account forked project will be present in your profile GitHub repository

31. to contribute to any project upon fork 
now, that you can access the contents of the public repository
you can add upstream url of the project to your profile in gitbash using command
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kunal-kushwaha/DSA-Bootcamp-Java.git   (this upstream url must be real public repository url ex. above one is of Kunal-Kushwaha profile)
on
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Akarsh-Kantimath/DSA-Bootcamp-Java.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Akarsh-Kantimath/DSA-Bootcamp-Java.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/kunal-kushwaha/DSA-Bootcamp-Java.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/kunal-kushwaha/DSA-Bootcamp-Java.git (push)

32. Imp. for every feature, bug or new thing --> always open a new branch
on other words one branch to have one pull request to have distribution of the work separately, 
It reduces the multiple pull request creation for each branch -> It helps in the review

33. How to remove a commit history from GitHub repository
touch names.txt
git add .
git commit -m "names.txt added"
git push origin Akarsh

Now, to remove the commit history from GitHub completely command 
git push origin Akarsh -f 
is used, -f refers to the forceful removal of commit

34. How to sync with main branch of upstream with my own fork branch main
way 1: in GitHub you can click on Fetch upstream button
--------------------
way 2: Manually syncing with upstream branch
git checkout main
git fetch --all --prune 
(to my local machine all the upstream changes are received)
(--prune refers to changes which are deleted as well are fetched)
git reset --hard upstream/main
git log
git push origin main
(from local machine upstream changes are pushed to GitHub online)   
---------------------
way 3: different command similar to way 2 manual sync
git pull upstream main 
(to my local machine all the upstream changes are received)
git push origin main
(from local machine upstream changes are pushed to GitHub online)  

35. Squashing commits in Git means combining multiple commit entries into a single, clean commit.
way 1: through reset command 
git reset 6bc4d8bf8ac5e434ac9083e1c01210e42f2a762c
git status
On branch temp
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        1.txt
        2.txt
        3.txt
git add .
git commit -m "added 1, 2, 3.txt"
-------------------------------
way2: through rebase command
git rebase -i 6bc4d8bf8ac5e434ac9083e1c01210e42f2a762c
(here -i refers to inter-active environment)
there in the interactive environment  
by using i (to insert)
you can either pick or s (squash) the commits
pick 3738hf9
s 448hfu9
s 482hh72
pick 8493hfw
first three will be merged to pick 3738hf9 as one commit
pick 8493hfw as a other commit
Esc key :x enter button 
again in inter-active environment 
by using i (to insert)
you can type a message of the commit 
Esc key :x enter button 
git log

36. to remove the commits, file changes without the stash, we can use hard command
git reset --hard 6bc4d8bf8ac5e434ac9083e1c01210e42f2a762c

===================================================================================
37. to change the branch name from master to main
change the branch name locally
git branch -m master main
now, push new branch to remote repository and set the upstream
git push -u origin main
in the remote set default branch as main, by going through repository settings
then, in the locally delete the master branch by
git push origin --delete master
====================================================================================
38. to rename a file 
local machine
mv old_filename new_filename

for a git
git mv old_filename new_filename
git commit -m "Renamed file from old_filename to new_filename"
git push origin branch_name
=======================================================================================
39. to go back to previous commit
git reset --hard <commit-hash>     if you have to use --soft, keeps the changes staged. In case of hard changes are removed from local
git push --force 
Reset rewrites history by moving the branch pointer

There is also revert - safely undoes commits via new commits, and checkout switches states or restores files. Adds new undo commit
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin <branch>
